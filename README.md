# VulnHunter
VulnHunter is a high-performance, asynchronous web vulnerability scanner built with Python, Flask, and asyncio. It uses a recursive crawler to map a target site and concurrently tests for XSS, SQL Injection, and LFI vulnerabilities. Findings are managed via a web dashboard with status tracking and CSV export capabilities.
